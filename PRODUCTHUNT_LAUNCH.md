## First Comment (Post immediately after launch)
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], and I built RACIO because I was spending way too much time resizing videos for different platforms.

Every time I made a video, I had to:
- Open video editor
- Resize for TikTok (9:16)
- Resize for Instagram feed (1:1)  
- Resize for YouTube (16:9)
- Export 3 separate files

That's 20+ minutes of tedious work for each video! 😫

So I built RACIO. Now I just paste my video once, and it automatically generates all three formats in about 5 seconds.

I'd love your feedback! What other formats or features would be helpful?

Excited to share that RACIO just launched on Product Hunt! 🎉

After months of building, I finally shipped a tool that solves a problem I faced daily: manually resizing videos for every platform.

RACIO lets you paste one video and instantly get versions for TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.

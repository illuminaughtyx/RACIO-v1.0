## First Comment (Post IMMEDIATELY after launch)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], the solo builder behind RACIO.

I've been creating content for years, and the most annoying part was never
the creative work — it was the 20 minutes AFTER, manually resizing the
same video for TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter.

So I built RACIO. Now my workflow looks like this:

1. Drop my video (or paste a Twitter/X URL)
2. All 6 formats generate automatically
3. Download everything with one click
4. Done in literally 1 second for images

Here's what makes it different from Canva or other tools:
• No learning curve — just drop a file
• No account needed — zero friction
• Handles images AND video
• 6 formats simultaneously, not one at a time
• Under 1 second for images (try it, seriously)

The tech stack is Next.js + FFmpeg running on a single server, processing
everything server-side for quality and speed.

I'd love your honest feedback:
• What formats am I missing?
• What would make you switch from your current workflow?
• Would an API be useful for your team?

Thanks for checking it out! 🙏

## Social Media Posts

### Twitter Launch Thread

```
🧵 I just launched RACIO on Product Hunt.

Here's the story of why I built it 👇

1/ Every creator knows the pain:

You make ONE video. Then you spend 20 minutes resizing it for:
- TikTok (9:16)
- Instagram Feed (1:1)
- YouTube (16:9)
- Instagram Portrait (4:5)
- Pinterest (2:3)

It's mind-numbing busy work. 😫

2/ I tried every tool:
- Canva → Too slow, 5 minutes per format
- Premiere Pro → Overkill for just resizing
- Online converters → Sketchy websites, low quality

None of them could just take ONE file and give me EVERYTHING.

3/ So I built RACIO.

Drop a file. Get 6 formats back. Under 1 second for images.

No login. No watermarks (on Pro). No nonsense.

Try it: https://racio.app

4/ The tech is simple but fast:
- Next.js frontend
- FFmpeg on the server
- Smart padding (no cropping, no stretching)
- Files auto-delete in 1 hour (privacy first)

5/ It handles images AND videos:
- Images: <1 second processing
- Videos: <30 seconds processing
- Up to 4K image quality
- 1080p HD video

6/ Built this entire thing solo in 6 weeks.

Would mean the world if you checked it out on Product Hunt today.

If you're a creator, I'd love your feedback.
What's missing? What would make this a must-have?

### LinkedIn Post

```
🚀 Today I launched RACIO on Product Hunt.

After 6 weeks of building solo, I finally shipped a tool that
solves a problem every content creator faces:

Manually resizing content for every social platform.

RACIO takes one file and instantly generates versions for
TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest, and more.

Some numbers:
⚡ <1 second for images
📹 <30 seconds for video
📱 6 formats simultaneously
🔒 Files auto-delete (privacy first)

The backstory:
I was spending 20+ minutes per video just on resizing.
Not editing. Not creating. Just... making it fit.

So I built the tool I wished existed.

If you're a creator, social media manager, or agency —
I'd love your honest feedback.

Title: I built a tool that converts any file to every social media
format in 1 second — just launched on PH

Hey everyone!

After 6 weeks of solo building, I launched RACIO today.

The problem: Every platform wants a different aspect ratio.
Resizing manually takes forever.

The solution: Drop one file → get 6 platform-ready formats instantly.

Tech stack: Next.js, FFmpeg, hosted on Render
Revenue: Freemium ($7/mo Pro, $79 Lifetime)

Would love feedback from fellow builders:
1. Is the pricing right?
2. What features am I missing?
3. Would you pay for an API?

# RACIO — Investment/Acquisition Pitch
## For: Aravind Srinivas, CEO @ Perplexity AI

---

## The One-Liner

**RACIO is the content formatting layer for the internet.** One file in, every platform-ready format out — in under 1 second.

---

## The Problem (Everyone Has It)

Every creator, brand, and company posting on social media faces the same friction:

- **Instagram** wants 1:1, 4:5, 9:16
- **YouTube** wants 16:9 (and 9:16 for Shorts)
- **TikTok** wants 9:16
- **Twitter/X** wants 16:9 or 1:1
- **LinkedIn** wants 1:1 or 16:9
- **Pinterest** wants 2:3

**Result:** Creators manually resize the same content 4-6 times per post. This takes 15-30 minutes per piece of content. At scale, brands spend **hours weekly** on something that should take seconds.

There is no dominant tool solving this, only workarounds:
- Canva (slow, manual, overkill)
- Adobe Express (complex, expensive)
- "Just post the same size everywhere" (looks broken)

## Why This Is Bigger Than a Tool

RACIO isn't just a converter. It's the **formatting layer** that sits between content creation and content distribution.

### The Content Pipeline

```
[Create Content] → [Format for Platforms] → [Distribute]
     ↑                    ↑                      ↑
  Canva/Adobe         🔥 RACIO 🔥           Buffer/Hootsuite
  ChatGPT/Perplexity                        Later/Sprout
```

**Every AI content tool generates content in ONE format.** None of them solve the last-mile problem of making it fit every platform. RACIO is that last mile.

### The Perplexity Connection

Perplexity is building the future of information consumption. As Perplexity expands into:
- **Content generation** (answers as shareable cards/images)
- **Visual answers** (diagrams, infographics)
- **Perplexity Pages** (publishable content)

...the formatting problem becomes yours too. Imagine:

> "Perplexity, create a marketing carousel about our Q4 results"
> → Perplexity generates the content
> → RACIO formats it for Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Stories
> → User clicks "Post Everywhere"

**RACIO becomes Perplexity's content distribution engine.**

## Traction & Numbers

| Metric | Current |
|--------|---------|
| Live URL | [racio.app](https://racio.app) |
| Stack | Next.js, FFmpeg, Node.js |
| Infra cost | ~$7/mo (Render free tier) |
| Revenue model | Freemium ($7/mo Pro, $79 Lifetime) |
| Payment system | Lemon Squeezy (live, accepting payments) |
| Time to build | 6 weeks, solo developer |

*Note: Early stage — focused on product-market fit before growth.*

## The Market

| Segment | Size |
|---------|------|
| Social media management tools | $25B by 2028 |
| Video editing software | $4.7B |
| Content creation tools | $16B |
| **Content formatting (underserved)** | **Untapped** |

The "formatting" layer is currently buried inside larger tools (Canva, Adobe). No one owns it as a standalone category. First-mover advantage is real.

### Comparable Exits & Valuations

| Company | What they do | Valuation |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Canva | Design tool | $26B |
| Descript | Video editing | $553M |
| Opus Clip | AI video clipping | $150M+ |
| Captions | AI video captions | $500M |
| **RACIO** | **Content formatting** | **Seed stage** |
